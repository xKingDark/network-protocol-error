# Network Protocol Error
"Network Protocol Error" is a disconnection message that you get when the Minecraft: Java Edition client receives malformed or unexpected network packets and forcibly disconnects.
This mod was created to mitigate frequent disconnects on unstable or misbehaving servers, making it especially useful in those environments.

While this mod helps with the annoyance of repeated disconnections, it should be used at your own risk. Preventing disconnects may lead to unexpected behavior or minor bugs, so caution is advised.
